# Weather App

With respect to my 30-day challenge to build mini-projects/feature in react.js, this is my day-2 project; a simple **weather appllication** that provide current weather data for cities, and countries in any part of the world.

## Getting started
If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

Download the ZIP from this location, or run the following git command to clone the files to your machine:
- Once the files are on your machine, open the counter application folder in Visual Studio Code.
- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the Go Live button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with Live Server.
